How do I define Out of Gauge (OOG) and Breakbulk (BB) cargo?

OOG Standards (including the packing)

- L: within 11.65 m
- W: exceeds 2.43m
- H: exceeds 2.23m (20FR) or 1.95 (40FR)
- Weight: within 34.5 mt

BB Standards (including the packing)
- L: exceeds 11.65m
- W: exceeds 4m
- H: exceeds 4m
- Weight: exceeds 34.5 mt
- or any combination of the above

Please note that these standards apply in most cases but are still subject to cargo outlines, weight distribution, terminal capabilities etc, 

Voided space calculation

- Over-height (Total space occupied - 20' : 2 teu / 40' : 4 teu)

Height limit: 20'FL – 2.23m ; 40'FL – 1.95m

 



- Over-width (20' : 3 teu / 40' : 6 teu)




- Over-width and height  (20' : 6 teu / 40' : 12 teu)



Terminal and Inland Operational Restrictions

Different cities and countries have their own restrictions.
